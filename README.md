# KinectFingerTracking
High-precision finger tracking API for the Microsoft Kinect 2.0 sensor

This project aims to create an API for high-resolution, high-precision finger tracking using only the data available from the depth and RGB cameras on the Kinect 2.0. 

We want to create this API and make it available to everyone so more people can tap into the incredible power and detail of the Kinect sensor, for applications in video games and beyond.
